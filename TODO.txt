- Add a hook to 000_sitetools_hook.pth to track the changes to the path
  that setuptools-installed packages make. Then we can make sure to insert
  everything from KS_PYTHON_SITES and KS_PYTHON_VENVS before that.

- How can `dev` extend $PATH based off of the new venvs, when that will
  trigger a execution in a new venv, and we will lose the packages from
  the old one?

    - Idea 1: KS_PYTHON_VENVS contains the old and new. If it turns out
      that sys.prefix is in there, then everything before it will be added
      to the front of sys.path, and everything behind it to the end of sys.path.

      This will not work since sitetools will not exist in the new environment.
      Perhaps, we could "infect" all of the venvs to import sitetools?! That
      does not sound very appealing...
