- Add a hook to 000_sitetools_hook.pth to track the changes to the path
  that setuptools-installed packages make. Then we can make sure to insert
  everything from KS_SITES before that.

- If the hook fails it should identify the file it is in so that it can be
  removed:
    import os; print 'HI from', fullname

- Document sitecutsomize hook.
- Detect if sitecustomize hook with fail.
  - Offer to install sitetools or "infect" to new venv with a *.pth file
    which will accomplish the same as the sitecustomize hook.

- If sys.prefix is in $KS_SITES, then everything before it will be added
  to the front of sys.path, and everything behind it to the end of sys.path.
