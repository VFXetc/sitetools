- include monkeypatch from metatools so that we don't need to depend on it?

- docs:
    - stub
    - environ freezing
    - dependency on metatools
    - monkey patches in use
    - logging setup
    - extensions to site-packages
    - utils.verbose

- Implement __pycache__ in metatools and sitecustomize
  see: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3147

- support platform-specific Python modules

    .site.pth (same as __site__.pth): build/lib.{platform_specifier}
        This would require a string.format shim for 2.5.
    .site.yml:
        path:
            - build/lib.{platform_specifier}
        after_deploy:
            - make build-platforms
            - python -m sitecustomize.precompile .

    make build-platforms: Qube job to build on all versions on all platforms

    python setup.py build --build-lib=. to tell it where to build to
    
    plat_name = get_platform()
    platform_specifier = "%s-%s" % (plat_name, sys.version[0:3])

    This string comes out the same on both types of farm machine, are they
    compatible? If they aren't, we can construct a more specific string from
    platform.platform.

    Is there a way that we could have extensions auto-compiled at import time?!

    Could use `python setup.py bdist_egg` to create complete binary eggs!

    Build a deployment/compiling stage for all the tools, so that we can swap
    out the whole tool quickly via a sym-link. This would need an entire
    deployed copy per developer, though...
